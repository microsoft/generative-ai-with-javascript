### Content organization

You'll find in the repo all the content associated with the video series, including slides, demos, scripts, as well as additional code samples, tutorials, and resources.
You can use it to follow along with the series, run the demos, replay the sessions or reuse the content in your own presentations. Once you've learned what you need, you can use the code samples and tutorials to kickstart your own AI applications.

It's organized as follows:
- [**Sessions**](sessions/): Contains the description, abstracts, resources links and scripts for each session.
- [**Slides**](slides/): Contains the slides for each session.
- [**Demos**](demos/): Contains the demos associated with each session.
- [**Tutorials**](../docs/additional-resources.md#tutorials): Contains hands-on tutorials that you can follow to learn more about AI and JavaScript.
- [**Code samples**](../docs/additional-resources.md#code-samples): Contains code samples that you can use as a starting point for your own projects.
- [**Community**](../docs/additional-resources.md#community): How to join the Azure AI community on Discord.
